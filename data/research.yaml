  position: "Researcher"
  responsibilities:
   - title: "CCAT Readout Development"
     description: "Led software and system development for the Prime-Cam instrument MKID readouts on the Fred Young Submillimeter Telescope (FYST/CCAT), a 6-meter, facility-class observatory. The role required a holistic approach to system design, integrating Linux-based control systems with parallel Xilinx ZCU111 RFSoC boards managing multiple detector arrays. Development was primarily in Python and included technologies such as Redis for messaging and data storage, all within a complex Dockerized control environment that interfaces with telescope and instrument software."
   - title: "CCAT Quick-Look Map Maker Development"
     description: "Conducted performance-optimized development of a quick-look map-making tool for the PrimeCam data pipeline. Work involved detailed analysis of BLAST-TNG MKID data to characterize detector noise and required deep expertise in astronomical map-making methodologies and optimization techniques."
